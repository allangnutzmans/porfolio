# Dashboard

**Dashboard** - is a lightweight, minimal, fast loading front-end dashboard theme. It is built with Vue.js and Nuxt.js.

The UI design of the theme is taken from the original work of [Aysenur Turk](https://codepen.io/TurkAysenur).

This project uses [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Start development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Notes
- State management uses [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/).
- Nuxt 3 uses the Composition API and `<script setup>` syntax for components.
- For more information, see the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs).

## Build Setup

You will need a Windows, Mac, or Linux computer with access to the command-line and permission to install new system packages. An active internet connection is required in order to install the following required software:

- Node https://nodejs.org/en/
- NPM https://www.npmjs.com/
- Yarn https://yarnpkg.com/
- Vue CLI https://cli.vuejs.org/

Using the terminal, navigate to the folder containing the unzipped theme and run the `npm install` command. This will install all of the required packages and prepare your project for local development and production deployment. Once complete, type `npm run dev` and press the <kbd>enter</kbd> key. Vue CLI will then compile the project and serve a local server located at http://localhost:8080/dashboard/.

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
